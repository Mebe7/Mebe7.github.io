    <!-- Hi Professor Edmunds! I know that this website is atrocious. I am working on coding a website which is actually good, but it isn't quite finished yet so I decided to make the worse
	looking website that I could (while still following the directions you gave us). I plan to have the real one up by the end of the week, and I hope that this suffices for now. Thanks!-->

    <!-- I did the worst things I could think of: overuse of animated gifs, mismatched pictures, bad color scheme, outdated look, outdated navigation scheme. Hopefully they're not too bad, I still want to 
        hopefully get a good grade, but they're bad enough to create that cring-y feeling that sometimes happens when browsing the web.-->
